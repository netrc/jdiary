<h2> After The War </h2>
After the war, Jesse returned to Michigan and went back to finish at Albion College. There he met and in 1921 married Mildred McIlvenna and returned to Royal Oak where he joined his father in the construction business. His family grew to three sons - James, Donald, Thomas, and Arthur. Tragically, Arthur died at age two.

Jesse died of a heart attack at 38 years old in 1934 in his hometown of Royal Oak, Michigan.

His son James went on to serve in WWII in the Pacific as Air Force navigator; Donald was in the Navy (?); Thomas (my father) served in the Army in the late '50s working on the Mercury Redstone missile project.

Today, the descendent of Jesse's unit is the [|17th Weapons Squadron|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17th_Weapons_Squadron] flying F-15E Strike Eagles out of [|Nellis Air Force Base|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nellis_AFB], Nevada.

Ed Moore's D.S.C. citation [|http://www.homeofheroes.com/members/02_DSC/citatons/01_wwi_dsc/dsc_05wwi_AirService2.html]

MOORE, EDWARD RUSSELL
First Lieutenant (Air Service), U.S. Army
Pilot, 8th Aero Squadron, Air Service, A.E.F.
Date of Action: October 9, 1918

Citation:
The Distinguished Service Cross is presented to Edward Russell Moore, First Lieutenant (Air Service), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in action near Thiaucourt, France, October 9, 1918. Lieutenant Moore, with First Lieutenant Gardner Philip Allen, observer, took advantage of a short period of fair weather during generally unfavorable atmospheric conditions to undertake a photographic mission behind the German lines. Accompanied by two protecting planes, they had just commenced their mission when they were attacked by eight enemy planes, which followed them throughout their course, firing at the photographic plane. Lieutenant Moore, pilot, with both firing wires cut by bullets, a landing wire shot away, his elevators riddled with bullets, and both wings punctured, continued on his prescribed course, although it made him an easy target. Lieutenant Allen was thus enabled in the midst of the attack to take pictures of the exact territory assigned, and he made no attempt to protect the plane with his machine guns. Displaying entire disregard of his personal danger and steadfast devotion to duty, the two officers successfully accomplished their mission.

Frank J. Campbell and Henry Ewald joined forces in 1911 but by 1917, two years before Chevrolet parked its account at the agency, Campbell was gone. He had sold his shares and peaced-out to war-torn France to work at a YMCA canteen. While Campbell still had his name on the door -- and it came first! -- Ewald was left to build the business, turning it into one of the biggest agencies around. Meanwhile, Campbell, a vet of the Spanish-American War, became a real-life prototype for the Most Interesting Man in the World, quite literally defying death. He survived a mustard gas attack. He was selected to hang a man for treason in World War II. He handled live rattlesnakes. Even his death was awesome: He was crushed by a 2,000-pound boulder while searching for agate rocks in Oregon at age 72. He basically did everything -- everything except run the ad agency with his name on it.  - http://adage.com/article/agency-news/mather-meet-lesser-men-famous-agency-names/241085/
