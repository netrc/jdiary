<h2> After The War </h2>
After the war, Jesse returned to Michigan and went back to finish at Albion College. There he met and in 1921 married Mildred McIlvenna and returned to Royal Oak where he joined his father in the construction business. His family grew to three sons - James, Donald, Thomas, and Arthur. Tragically, Arthur died at age two.

Jesse died of a heart attack at 38 years old in 1934 and is [|buried|https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=121456022] in his hometown of Royal Oak, Michigan.

His son James went on to serve in WWII in the Pacific as Air Force navigator; Donald was in the Navy; Thomas (my father) served briefly in the Army in the late '50s and later in Chrysler Corporation's Missile Division.

Today, the descendent of Jesse's unit is the [|17th Weapons Squadron|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17th_Weapons_Squadron] flying F-15E Strike Eagles out of [|Nellis Air Force Base|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nellis_AFB], Nevada.

Jesse Campbell Letters, 1917-1918 - [|https://photos.app.goo.gl/z2npFyV1PIPjsYXY2]. Four letters written to Albion College friend Bob Crosthwaite. The first three were written while still training in England, the last written during a rainy spell in October 1918 in France. Note all the letters are signed with the nickname "Jockey".

'A History of the 17th Aero Squadron', Frederick Clapp, 1920 - full text at [|https://archive.org/details/historyof17thaer00claprich]. A marvelously written eye-witness account of the squadron, including many anecdotes of operations and living conditions written by one of the officers, 1st Lieutenant Frederick Clapp, adjutant. Includes transcripts of combat and bombing reports and other statistics. Abbreviated as "H17".

'War Birds - Diary of An Unknown Aviator', John Grider, 1917-1918 - full text at [|https://archive.org/details/warbirdsdiaryofu00unse]. A rollicking, severely embellished autobiographical tale of a ship and ground-school mate of Jesse. Most of the first-half of the "diary" tells of the drinking and carousing of John Grider, with little information about flying or instruction. Apparently, this work is heavily amended by Grider's friend and air service comrade Elliot Springs. Abbreviated as "WB".

'The Camels Are Coming', W.E. Johns, 1932. The first of the classic English war series of Cpt. James "Biggles" Bigglesworth. W.E. Johns was in the Royal Flying Corps/Royal Air Force and went on to teach at Marske-by-the-Sea during the time Jesse was there. While the adventures are fictional, the descriptions of the pilot's life, language, and descriptions of fighter action on the Western Front are accurate. Coincidentally, the title of the book is a play on the well-known Scottish song, 'The Campbells are Coming'. Abbreviated as "CAC".

<blockquote>
MOORE, EDWARD RUSSELL
First Lieutenant (Air Service), U.S. Army
Pilot, 8th Aero Squadron, Air Service, A.E.F.
Date of Action: October 9, 1918

Citation:
The Distinguished Service Cross is presented to Edward Russell Moore, First Lieutenant (Air Service), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in action near Thiaucourt, France, October 9, 1918. Lieutenant Moore, with First Lieutenant Gardner Philip Allen, observer, took advantage of a short period of fair weather during generally unfavorable atmospheric conditions to undertake a photographic mission behind the German lines. Accompanied by two protecting planes, they had just commenced their mission when they were attacked by eight enemy planes, which followed them throughout their course, firing at the photographic plane. Lieutenant Moore, pilot, with both firing wires cut by bullets, a landing wire shot away, his elevators riddled with bullets, and both wings punctured, continued on his prescribed course, although it made him an easy target. Lieutenant Allen was thus enabled in the midst of the attack to take pictures of the exact territory assigned, and he made no attempt to protect the plane with his machine guns. Displaying entire disregard of his personal danger and steadfast devotion to duty, the two officers successfully accomplished their mission.

<blockquote>
Frank J. Campbell and Henry Ewald joined forces in 1911 but by 1917, two years before Chevrolet parked its account at the agency, Campbell was gone. He had sold his shares and peaced-out to war-torn France to work at a YMCA canteen. While Campbell still had his name on the door -- and it came first! -- Ewald was left to build the business, turning it into one of the biggest agencies around. Meanwhile, Campbell, a vet of the Spanish-American War, became a real-life prototype for the Most Interesting Man in the World, quite literally defying death. He survived a mustard gas attack. He was selected to hang a man for treason in World War II. He handled live rattlesnakes. Even his death was awesome: He was crushed by a 2,000-pound boulder while searching for agate rocks in Oregon at age 72. He basically did everything -- everything except run the ad agency with his name on it.

<h3> Derogatory Terms </h3>

Jesse's Diary uses a few old-fashioned derogatory terms for the enemy.

"Hun" is a reference to a speech given by Emperor Wilhelm II in 1900, where he urged on his army to fight in the Boer War with the famed tenacity of the Hun empire.

"Boche" from French slang for cabbage/head.
