<h1> Introduction </h1>
Jesse Frank Campbell was born in March 1896 in Royal Oak, Michigan, a suburb some 10 miles north of Detroit. His father was a building contractor and later Postmaster of the town. Both parents were members of the Royal Oak Congregational Church and of the local temperance union.

His ancestors came from Scotland to live in Northern Ireland in the 1600s and were among the many "Scotch-Irish" to emigrate to the United States. Robert Campbell arrived in Boston in 1719, and set up farming in Voluntown, Connecticut along with wife, children, and extended family. A few decades later, William Campbell, Jesse's great-great-great-grandfather, was a member of the Connecticut militia that rode in support of the Lexington and Concord "shot heard 'round the world".

He graduated from the local high school and had been a member of the undefeated senior class football team. He went on to study at Albion College in Michigan, known by his nickname 'Jockey'. In April 1917, the United States entered the war and Jesse enlisted in the Army Reserve Officer Training Corps at age 21, going through basic training at Fort Sheridan, Illinois. (Note that Jesse's middle name came from his uncle, Frank Campbell, founding partner of Campbell-Ewald advertising agency. Frank had sold his position in the firm and afterwards joined the U.S. Army, being posted to France to coordinate various relief and supply operations.)

The early US air service was part of the [|U.S. Signal Corps|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_Section,_U.S._Signal_Corps] and composed of volunteers. Jesse’s volunteer group went through basic training and ground school at the [|University of Illinois|https://archives.library.illinois.edu/blog/military-aeronautics/] in Champaign, Illinois. Due to the lack of airplanes, airfields, and instructors -- the U.S. was woefully unprepared for combat, especially aerial warfare at the time -- the plan was for all cadets to finish their training overseas.

The majority of the [|17th Aero Squadron|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17th_Aero_Squadron] was formed and trained at Kelly Field, near San Antonio, Texas and later around Toronto, getting over to England and then France in early 1918. <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HP4pzAnHC7wSeMbQxCWn0iKGwI5iqxJKiYcnMnIWFXSdIf82yQeUUf6_zK2TVqXgsKZaByLxEoqNy2W7v-MXkk1MhYQBGIVkroEKdQVUVVNS41Hpx_ZSIL4RZJP0xRlLFBpKz2P6xnb17hhuvDvpWLgk0GLc9BbphYUZ5U3e6wNeutXiZPb06DTMQcAqHnTPV2epL9oSVTCljI0ywEb_nJ9dxDgpr_o6ivIdiTUYGschpaoCLhznUaiw_w4SDIU6UdxuCgzPn-8ENOP-SZLFvE7GmfQX3go0ScOFfTUk8m_TNPzpgs-CAOE6idTguGRe6cLBpOzIh04wcvTLTHUhdgywOmC8GlkZWHREh3FCG5n8Bdn6vAX7jmJtlVWq6MnRbiMxYy0YOiKSA2BMA64gI5UfqvtwIcxcWmpzEMMynQmjCU3JTDjvGoo4RE_9JHHZBog07kR29M-jzwKulKeuPTyS66wfkD6DtlN_sVDvKtT6kNVSOqyjwHyJdffEfPPbImCzPmGmzKdwzY2LSwimVwhWyC3FkITFq2scci68yOKZnUW-r0Us8VbLWhoi8b32jwE_FKsTFioGeUVQ_ojfXpzcTlgMHV6hg9EeOphhyig=w100-h156" alt="journal" style="float: right; padding-left: 10px; margin-top: 20px;">

Jesse’s group finished their U.S. training in August 1917 and were sent to Camp Mills, in Long Island to await transport to England en route to [|Foggia, Italy|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foggia] to finish their flight training after which they would support the bombing campaign over the mountainous Austro-Hungarian border.

I imagine that during that wait, Jesse decided to keep a war-time diary and purchased a slim red-cloth-covered journal. His first entry began the evening of his departure, September 18, 1917.
