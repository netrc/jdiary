<h1> Introduction </h1>
Jesse Frank Campbell was born in March 1896 in Royal Oak, Michigan, a suburb some 10 miles north of Detroit. His father was a building contractor and later Postmaster of the town. Both parents were members of the Royal Oak Congregational Church and of the local temperance union.

His ancestors came from Scotland to live in Northern Ireland in the 1600s and were among the many "Scotch-Irish" to emigrate to the United States. Robert Campbell arrived in Boston in 1719, and set up farming in Voluntown, Connecticut along with wife, children, and extended family. A few decades later, William Campbell, Jesse's great-great-great-grandfather, was a member of the Connecticut militia that rode in support of the Lexington and Concord "shot heard 'round the world".

Much later, as The Great War started in Europe, Jesse would have been 18 years old. He graduated from the local high school and had been a member of the undefeated senior class football team. In 1917, while at Albion College in Michigan, the United States entered the war, and Jesse enlisted in the Army Reserve Officer Training Corps in April 1917 at age 21.

But he was given pilot training at Chanute Air Field, a little north of Champaign, Illinois. Due to the lack of airplanes, airfields, and instructors -- the U.S. was woefully unprepared for combat, especially aerial warfare at the time -- the plan was for airmen to finish their training overseas.

Jesse seems to have been in an ad-hoc group of airmen for the rest of the [|17th Aero Squadron|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17th_Aero_Squadron] was formed up and receiving instruction at [|Kelly Field|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Field_Historic_District], near San Antonio, Texas. They continued on to Toronto, Canada, before heading over to England in January, 1918. Jesse and his cadets finished the U.S. portion of training in August 1917 and were sent to Camp Mills in Long Island to await transport to England. <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HP4pzAnHC7wSeMbQxCWn0iKGwI5iqxJKiYcnMnIWFXSdIf82yQeUUf6_zK2TVqXgsKZaByLxEoqNy2W7v-MXkk1MhYQBGIVkroEKdQVUVVNS41Hpx_ZSIL4RZJP0xRlLFBpKz2P6xnb17hhuvDvpWLgk0GLc9BbphYUZ5U3e6wNeutXiZPb06DTMQcAqHnTPV2epL9oSVTCljI0ywEb_nJ9dxDgpr_o6ivIdiTUYGschpaoCLhznUaiw_w4SDIU6UdxuCgzPn-8ENOP-SZLFvE7GmfQX3go0ScOFfTUk8m_TNPzpgs-CAOE6idTguGRe6cLBpOzIh04wcvTLTHUhdgywOmC8GlkZWHREh3FCG5n8Bdn6vAX7jmJtlVWq6MnRbiMxYy0YOiKSA2BMA64gI5UfqvtwIcxcWmpzEMMynQmjCU3JTDjvGoo4RE_9JHHZBog07kR29M-jzwKulKeuPTyS66wfkD6DtlN_sVDvKtT6kNVSOqyjwHyJdffEfPPbImCzPmGmzKdwzY2LSwimVwhWyC3FkITFq2scci68yOKZnUW-r0Us8VbLWhoi8b32jwE_FKsTFioGeUVQ_ojfXpzcTlgMHV6hg9EeOphhyig=w100-h156" alt="journal" style="float: right; padding-left: 10px; margin-top: 20px;">

Oddly, in his diary, he writes about Italian language lessons his group was given in preparation for being sent to the Italian front: After Italy joined the Allies, its main goal was to annex some territory. To that end there was an aerial combat [|bombing campaign|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpo_Aeronautico_Militare] along the Austro-Hungarian mountain border which the U.S. was going to support, but Jesse's tour took a different turn.

One other note: His uncle, Frank Campbell, founding partner of Campbell-Ewald advertising firm, had also joined the U.S. Army and was posted to France and put in charge of some relief and supply operations.

I imagine that while waiting to ship out, Jesse purchased a slim red-cloth-covered journal and began his writing the evening of his departure, September 18, 1917.
