    A flight to Guizancourt w/ 84 Sq.
    B flight to Ste. Marie Cappel (Hazebrouck) w/ 60 Sq.

    "They knew now what it meant to send out patrols" - pilots? or just ground crew?

H17p12,13 - 1917-05-18 - "it was decided that the 17th should be put on 110 h.p. Le Rhone Sopwith Camels."
    "The mechanics were given a month to master their overhaul and upkeep."
    - sent to various squads to learn

    1917-06-20 to Petite Synthe
    "On June 20th all four flights were sent to a field at Petite Synth, near Dunkirk, to become once more a unit and resume their identity as a squadron"

H17p16 - British rule, saved many lives...
    "no pilot was to cross the lines until he had been three weeks in France and, in addition to showing marked proficiency in flying and maneuvering, had flown a certain number of hours on line patrol and had fired successfully a certain number of rounds from the air at a fixed target?"

H17p17 Major Harold Fowler "who was in a way our American Wing Commander"
    - had his own Camel, kept with ours, and a frequent visitor

    - Our "buses" collected from Marquise and tuned...
    "and had fired, early and late, at the aeroplane target, in the marsh, by the dunes of St. Pol-sur-Mer, till there was nothing left of it.

    "we received our official secret insignia, a white dumb-bell painted on each side of the fuselage aft of the cockpit.

    148th fought under White Triangle
    "Later, in contemplation of our return to the American Armies, we adopted "The Great Snow Owl"

H17p17,18 - Petit-Synth
    "The field... lies in a rough triangle....."
    "This was one of the oldest aerodromes in French Flanders... in the beginning to the Royal Naval Air Service."
    "The land round about is flat and often, in the morning and evening, full of ground mist. The weather too is full of the change-ableness of a sea-coast country"
    ...the spire of St. Eloi at Dunkirk,

    "housed in wooden huts, arranged inside for the hammocks .. of the Royal Naval Air Service."

H17p19 - notes on lights out, few bombing raids
    "once, the night we arrived, when he dropped a large one on the French Cavalry shack behind our mess, leaving a deep hole in the mud"

H17p21,22 - Chinese, reaction to our housekeeping;  Transports/cars
    "The chinese who had long ago camouflaged the hangers with strange characters of their own, watched our activities with smiles and curiosity"
    "one Crossly touring car, seven Layland lorries, five Crossly tenders, two workshop lorries, six trailers, two water-trailers, four motorcycle side-cars, eight motorcycles, as well as the five Fiat trucks with four trailers, a large water-trailer, one Harley-Davidson side-car and one Cadillac"

    Got replacement Sopwiths very quickly.

H17p24 - First O.P.  1918-07-15
    "We crossed the lines on offensive patrol for the first time on July 15, 1918. The front was very quiet. It was Williams who brought down our first enemy aeroplane not far from Ostend.. on July 20th."

H17p25,6 - Letter praising bomber escort of 1917-08-30
    "I do not consider that any Squadron in France could have supplied a better escort than No 17 U.S. Aero Squadron"
    Major G.R.M. Reid, C.O 211

    "during the period in which we escorted them, not a machine of theirs was lost as a result of attack by enemy aircraft"

H17p27 - arrival of Doctor Lt. Jacob J. Ross

H17p28 - first major fight. (Day that Jesse arrived)
    "The weather was warm and hazy on August first, the wind light and falling"
    First major skirmish, Lt. Robert Todd attacked Fokker biplane....

H17p29
    "Out of that patrol a great confidence was born.
    "..we knew now that our future as a fighting unit was safe"

    "we were to leave the 65th Wing"

H17p30 - The Varssenaere Aerdrom "show"  1918-08-13
    Very hard to see - must be the whole field in the center; between Jabekke/Varssenare/Snellegem
        http://www.belgian-wings.be/Webpages/Navigator/Photos/MilltaryPics/airfields/varssenaere.htm
    "The field in question, which was situated southwest of Bruges, was of great extent and housed not less than five squadrons of Gothas and Fokkers".
    Practice flight over British aerodrome at Andembert near Calais
    Attack: After 5th Group had dropped their boms, 17th dropped to 200 feet and released their bombs, then shot at hangars and huts, and a chateau on the NE corner of the aerodrome was also attacked.
    All returned safely

H17p37 - 1918-08-18 ordered to move to Auxi-Le-Chateau
    1918-08-19 - We arrived next day, covered with deep white dust of the road from Dunkirk, through St. Omer, Fruges, and Hesdin.
    "At Auxi our aerodrome was delightfully situated. It lay on rising ground, to the southeast of the town, on the old Auxi-leChateau-Crecy Road. The officers tents, well dug in, were peppered down a slope under the edge of a little forest of small trees.

H17p38 - balloon bombing; Hamilton / Morton Campbell
   1918-08-24 + 4 days
    "During the next four days we shot down a balloon a day"
    "It was on one of these expeditions that Lieutenant Hamilton, one of the most fearless and expert pilots we ever had, was shot down from the ground just as he was zooming away from the "sausage" he had set on fire - his second in two days".
H17p39 - ground strafing
    "In many ways, on the other hand, "ground strafing" is a severer test than most fighting of a pilots stamina and skill and of the rigging and fitting of his machine".
    This work served to shatter German troop faith in their own air cover

    Morton Campbell

    "Merton Campbell too was 'missing' on the 23rd, and when the Boche had gone back beyond Thiepval and Contalmaison we found his grave. He had landed, upside down, in that broad belt of shell-torn country where there is not a yard not shattered by heavy explosive. His grave was a low soft mound beside his crashed machine. On it, the usual inverted bottle, stuck in the mud, contained an envelope, blood-soaked and bearing his name. We made a cross of a broken four-bladed 'prop' of fine mahogany that we got from salvage, and engraved a nameplate on a copper disk. We took it up past wrecked villages and then more wrecked villages, into the old No Man's Land of some of the fiercest battles of the war. At the head of his grave without ceremony we set it up. He lies there, one of our stoutest, by a file of tree trunks smashed and stripped and grotesquely rigid against the sun, under a little slope of ground rising toward the east that has been blasted into dust by months of artillery fire."

    Both Hamilton and Campbell were at once awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross by the British.

H17p40-42 - full write up of 1918-08-26 'most tragic day'

H17p42
    "The Mess had an undercurrent that night that it seldom had."
    "For about a week the British wisely kept us out of the fray. New Buses arrived."

H17p43 - got a piano, wireless interruption
    - the line moved rapidly east, we set up advanced landing ground near Baupaume
    - from which we took up wireless interruption

H17p45 - break the cambrai front
    On Sept 20 we were ordered to proceed to Soncampe

    "Soncamp aerodrome is not far from the little town of Sombrin that lies rather scattered and nondescript - a typical French farming village - on the road through Grand Rullecourt to Frevent. It occupies - the aerodrome - the north side of a farm the house of which, enclosed in a large gray stone wall, suggests some relic of a small convent - an impression that the high archway into the great square farmyard strengthens. The hangars were permanent and of camouflaged corrugated iron. There were good Adrian huts as barracks for the enlisted men, and we pitched our officer's tents and the two marquees that were to be the Mess in a triangle of pasture, beside a growth of underbrush, at the upper end of the camp."

    "The mud in this camp was omnipresent and deep"

H17p46 - 1918-09-22 - a flourish
    "We opened the Soncamp chapter with a flourish on September 22nd. While on the morning patrol, Lt. Vaugn saw fifteen Fokkers dive, as he thought, on our "C" flight formation from 15,000 feet"

    p.47 the story of Tillinghast escape,

    DFC given to Lt. Vaugn

H17p48 - Dud weather for a while, but operations go on
    "The lines changed from day to day. Those were the days of the great battles, on the Third Army Front, for the Canal du Nord, the Hindenburg Line, the Canal de L'Escaut, and Cambrai. As the Boche retreated, even through cloud and rain, we bombed his transport and troop concentrations in teh sunken roads near Esmes and Estournel. Of Awoingt station, or "Up Wink" as the pilots called it, we made a special target and touched off its ammunition dumps".

H17p49 - 1918-09-24 scrap
    "On September 24th at 10 o'clock in the morning, our formation of fourteen machines saw, rather far off, an enemy formation of thirteen....
    p50 "... we had taken a toll of five destroyed and one driven down out of control, without losing a single pilot or machine." (Blue tails)
    "This picturesquely painted enemy circus was never again seen on the Front."

H17p51 - transfer to US
    moving to Cambrai, "But we did not move in to that region"
    "We were to 'Go South' which to us meant going to our own armies"
    "The order came to turn in our British supplies, which was done, and we prepared to entrain."
    "General Longcroft flew over in his Camel....", read a letter from General Byng, CO of British 3rd Army"

H17p53 - to Toul
    "On November 1st we entrained at the railhead at Saulty, proceeding the usual boxcars labelled "8 chevaux, 40 hommes" to Candas, and thence via Chateau Thierry and Cahlons, to Toul"
    "...at Toul aerodrome, on the north side of the city"

    "Spads were designated as the machines that we were to fly"
