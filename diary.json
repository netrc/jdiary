The British have three funnels while the American have four and area little longer. All are fast boats making from 35 to 40 knots an hour and have no trouble in running around our slow boats. The English take great pride in their warships and an amusing incident occured in connection therewith: An English lady who is aboard was talking to an officer about the destroyers and said they were the best in the world, far surpassing the American. \"Now look at that one,\" she said pointing to a four funneled destroyer off the starboard side. \"Isn't that the trimmest and neatest looking one you ever saw?\" The officer agrree that it was the best of the lot but the lady was quite taken aback when she was informed that it was an American destroyer.\nI feel quite a little safer now that they have arrived for this is really a dangerous region althought it is hard to realize it. It doesn't seem possible to sink a large steamer like this one but one small torpedo can do the business and leave few to tell the tale.\n Mines are more feared than submarines. When struck by a torpedo, the vessel sinks rather slowly while it is blown to pieces immediately upon striking a mine. I read the semaphoe signals between our boat and a destroyer and we were warned of a five mile area extending outward from a life buoy three miles off Fast head [G|Fastnet Rock] which is mined.\n There was a concert for the benefit of the families of British sailors who have been killed during the war. Wells sang and as usual brought the house down. The real treat however was Spalding's playing. He certainly is an artist with his violin and it is a real treat to hear him and much more to be embarked upon the same enterprise. War is a great equalizer.

On it, the usual inverted bottle, stuck in the mud, contained an envelope, blood-soaked and bearing his name. We made a cross of a broken four-bladed 'prop' of fine mahogany that we got from salvage, and engraved a nameplate on a copper disk. We took it up past wrecked villages and then more wrecked villages, into the old No Man's Land of some of the fiercest battles of the war. At the head of his grave without ceremony we set it up. He lies there, one of our stoutest, by a file of tree trunks smashed and stripped and grotesquely rigid against the sun, under a little slope of ground rising toward the east that has been blasted into dust by months of artillery fire.
