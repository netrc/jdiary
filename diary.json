The British have three funnels while the American have four and area little longer. All are fast boats making from 35 to 40 knots an hour and have no trouble in running around our slow boats. The English take great pride in their warships and an amusing incident occured in connection therewith: An English lady who is aboard was talking to an officer about the destroyers and said they were the best in the world, far surpassing the American. "Now look at that one," she said pointing to a four funneled destroyer off the starboard side. "Isn't that the trimmest and neatest looking one you ever saw?" The officer agrree that it was the best of the lot but the lady was quite taken aback when she was informed that it was an American destroyer.\nI feel quite a little safer now that they have arrived for this is really a dangerous region althought it is hard to realize it. It doesn't seem possible to sink a large steamer like this one but one small torpedo can do the business and leave few to tell the tale.\n Mines are more feared than submarines. When struck by a torpedo, the vessel sinks rather slowly while it is blown to pieces immediately upon striking a mine. I read the semaphoe signals between our boat and a destoryer and we were warned of a five mile area extending outward from a life buoy three miles off Fast head which is mined.\n There was a concert for the benefit of the families of British sailors who have been killed during the war. Wells sang and as usual brought the house down. The real treat however was Spalding's playing. He certainly is an artist with his violin and it is a real treat to hear him and much more to be embarked upon the same enterprise. War is a great equalizer. Before he would never play for less than $1,000 a night and now he is workig hard for $35 per month.",

Both were as fine officers as one could ask for and I was sorry to see them go. The trip to Oxford was through very pretty country and was especially interesting since it was my first view of England. I had expected the country here to be very much like U.S. but it is quite differnt. They seem to be 50 years behind times. In Birmingham, the houses all looked alike.

   Upon arriving at Oxford we were met by the Commandant of the College and taken to our quarters. Oxford College is subdivided into a number of colleges some of which are Brasenose, Christ, Jesus, Queens and Harris. I was sent to Braesnose. It seemed funny to hear them some talk of being sent to Jesus and sounded sacriligeous but I suppose it is alright. The buildings are very old some dating back to 1300.",
